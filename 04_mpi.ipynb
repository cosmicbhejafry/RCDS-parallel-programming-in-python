There are implementations of MPI for many programming languages, including C, C++, Fortran, and Python. Much of the functionality and many of the commands we will see here will be similar in other languages. \n",

By including it in the if-block, we make sure it is only called by rank 0. The first argument to `send` is the data to be sent. We also specify the destination rank so the message can be sent to rank 1. The `recv` method is called from rank 1 to receive the message from rank 0. The `source` argument specifies the rank of the process that sent the message. The data which is received is saved into the variable `data` and then printed. As we can see, we can send any type of data between ranks, including dictionaries, lists, and numpy arrays.\n",

    "## Sending Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we've seen before like `send`, `recv`, `isend`, and `irecv` send Python objects between ranks using a process called [pickling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). This process allows an arbitrarily complex object to be serialized so they can be sent between ranks. Whilst flexible in terms of the types of object that can be sent, the process of pickling and unpicking adds a significant performance overhead to the sending of data between ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some data types in Python, such as Numpy arrays, do not need to be pickled to be sent between ranks, which can speed up communication significantly. This can be done using functions with similar names to those we have already seen, except they begin with a capital letter, such as `Send` and `Recv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax we have to use is a little different than before. We need to prepare an object to receive the data before we call the `Recv` method. This array should be a Numpy array with the same shape and data type as the array we are sending. This prepares a section of the memory in receiving rank to receive the data and is known as a buffer. The function `numpy.empty` is an efficient way to create this buffer. It will allocate the memory for th Numpy array but will not initialize it, meaning it will contain junk values. This is faster than using `numpy.zeros` which would initialize the array to zeros. For many Numpy functions, including `empty`, the `dtype` argument is used to [specify the data type](https://numpy.org/doc/2.1/reference/arrays.dtypes.html) of the array. There are a few ways to do this, but one ay is to use the Python type names such as `int`, `float`, `complex`, etc.\n",

    "Share prices change over time in an unpredictable way. However, we can simulate how the share price might change over time using a geometric random walk. We can say that the price of a share on a given day is equal to the price of the share on the previous day multiplied by a random number drawn from a normal distribution with a given mean and standard deviation. We can simulate this process by generating a random number for each day and multiplying it by the share price on the previous day. We can do this for a number of days to simulate the share price over time. In the file [`share_price.py`](04_mpi_scripts/share_price.py) there is a function `simulate_share_price` which takes the initial share price, the mean of the normal distribution, the standard deviation of the normal distribution, and the number of days to simulate. This function returns the share price at the end of the final day of the simulated period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each call to this function will return a different final share price as a different set of random numbers will have been generated. This means we can call the function multiple times to get a distribution of final share prices. Your task is to write code which will call this code `n` times in total, split across each rank in the communicator. Once this is done, use collective communication to collect the results on rank zero and print the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the final share prices. The code should be able to be run with any number of ranks. Your code should have values for the initial share price, mean, standard deviation, and number of days to simulate, and the number of simulations to run hard-coded into the script. Try the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initial share price: 100\n",
    "* Mean fractional daily change: 0.001\n",
    "* Standard deviation of fractional daily change: 0.02\n",
    "* Number of days to simulate: 100\n",
    "* Number of simulations: 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the equations are the mean and standard deviation are:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i\\\\\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i^2 - \\bar{x}^2}\n",

    "\n",
    "Think carefully about how to structure your code and use the collective communication functions you've seen. There is a sample solution in the file [`sample_solutions/share_price.py`](sample_solutions/share_price.py). For reference, when I ran the sample solution, I got the following output:\n",

    "Your code will probably not produce the same results as the random numbers generated will be different, but your results should be similar."
